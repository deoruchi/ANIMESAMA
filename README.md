## Overview

### The challenge

To took up the challenge of make a clone of website **BackStageTalk**. This website fascinated me in an instance beacuse of its UI. The features of "ANIMEsama" is not whole of the clonned website but I have tried my best in my knowledge to make one adding my own ideas to it.

- This website will be showing summaries of each listed anime along with their
  - production studio
  - writer
  - director
  - name
  - where user can watch it.
- User have to click one of the listed anime names to view desired one.
- To view Anime Quotes (❁´◡`❁) user have to click on the top-right corner of the page.
  - There will be 10 random anime quotes along with anime names.
  - To change quotes click on the **naruto button** for new quotes (●'◡'●).

#### _For the Time Being this Website is resposive only for the desktop_
